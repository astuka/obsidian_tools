# Obsidian Tools

A series of tools to work with Obsidian at scale.

## CSV to Markdown

Takes in a set of CSV files and converts them to a set of markdown files.

## Notion Export Splitter

If you're using the Binary File Manager plugin with Obsidian, and are trying to import Notion files, you'll end up with a bunch of duplicate markdowns. This tool will split out the markdown files from the binary files so you can delete the markdowns and just keep the attachments.
