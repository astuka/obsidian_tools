# Obsidian Tools

A series of tools to work with Obsidian at scale.

## CSV to Markdown

Takes in a set of CSV files and converts them to a set of markdown files.

## Dupe Checker

A rather specific use case: If you're using the Binary File Manager plugin and are importing Notion files, this separates out the Notion markdown and allows you to just keep the binary files. Also automatically gets rid of the hashes that Notion adds to their filenames.
